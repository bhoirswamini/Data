# Data-Warehouse and Business Intelligence for Walmart and Netflix
The project involved Business Intelligence and ETL to merge two companies, Fudgemart and FudgeFlix, which have a similar business model as Walmart and Netflix.
This project's main objective is to create a data warehouse using the Microsoft SSIS ETL tool. The ETL process will extract data from the Fudgemart and Fudgeflix databases and load it into the data warehouse. The stakeholders can utilize this data warehouse to identify and address issues related to the business processes of Fudgemart and Fudgeflix. Additionally, I utilized Microsoft PowerBI to develop dashboards that present actionable insights to stakeholders. 
This project followed the below steps:
1. Extracting data from Fudgemart and Fudgeflix OLTP data sources and loading required dimensions and fact tables in Data Warehouse
2. Fetching data from External Sources  that has useful datasets for data warehousing.
3. Creation of a PowerBI Dashboard for getting actionable business insights using MOLAP cubes
